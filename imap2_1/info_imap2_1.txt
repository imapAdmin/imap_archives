% UPDATES DETAILS
%
% Version 2.1
% 1- Solve potential problems when the dimensions (x,y) of the search space is not an even number of pixels
% Version 2
% 1- The setting of the parameters is now done via a configuration structure (see examples), which allows more flexibility in calling iMap, but gives also to the user flexibility in inserting his own parameters.
% 2- New parameters have been added for: setting the colorbar scaling, setting the sigma (kernel for the statistical smoothing), setting the significancy of the threshold.
% 3- The "clicking step" used to generate the maps is no longer necessary. Many thanks to Junpeng Lao who wrote the ‘indtorgb’ function.
% 4- The one-tailed and two-tailed critical values (found in Zcrit.txt or displayed in the Matlab command window) are defined from the value of the significancy threshold set as one of the parameters.
% 5- The contours for significant areas are now displayed in white for all the fixation maps. It should improve the view of the significant areas.
% 6- A mistake in the data preparation code for the scenes example has been fixed.
% Version 1.1
% 1- Fixes potential problems with floating point in the calculation of the search-space size
% 2- Creates a Zcrit.txt file indicating the size of the search-space, the default critical value of a one-tailed Z for alpha = .05 (significancy threshold for the individual maps),
% the default critical value of a two-tailed Z for alpha = .05 (significancy threshold for the difference map). This information is also displayed in the Matlab command window.
% 3- The CiVol and STAT_THRESHOLD functions have been modified to avoid the display of confusing information in the Matlab command window.

% VARIABLES that can be set in the cfg structure
% imap (xSize, ySize, columnx, columny, columnduration, columnitem, dataset1, dataset2, standard deviation, maptype, firstfix, backgroundfile, specificfix, searchspace), with
% 1-	xSize and ySize: stimulus size in pixels (e.g. 382, 390)
% IMPORTANT: Please keep in mind that the stimulis dimentions (xSize and ySize) might be inverted depending on whether the user considers them in graph coordinates (abscissa/ordinate, bottom left origin), screen coordinates (top left origin) or matrices (number of lines first, number of columns second). Here we consider matrix coordinates.
% 2-	columnx, columny, columnduration, columnitem: specify the column number for x, y coordinates, fixation durations and item number. This allows flexible data format. By defaults these columns are 1, 2, 3 and 4
% 3-	dataset1 and dataset2: specify the data .mat files that will be tested/compared. For example [1:20], [21:40] to compare data1 to data20 with data 21 to data40. The second data set is optional. If only one dataset is tested, iMap produces a statistical map and eye-tracking indexes for this dataset. If two datasets are specified, iMap provides the statistical maps and eye-tracking indexes for both dataset and the difference map and indexes.
% 4-	smoothingpic: Standard deviation in pixels of the Gaussian used for the data map smoothing. The default value is 10 pixels.
% 5-    smoothingstat: Standard deviation in pixels of the Gaussian used for the statistics smoothing (PIXEL-TEST). The default value is 10 pixels. FOR COHERENCE BETWEEN  THE DISPLAY AND THE STATISTICAL TEST, WE HIGHLY RECOMMAND TO USE A IDENTICAL VALUE FOR SMOOTHINGPIC AND SMOOTHINGSTAT IN CASE THE DEFAULT VALUES ARE NOT KEPT.
% 6-	maptype: 1 for fixation duration maps, 2 for number of fixations maps. The default value is 1.
% 7-	firstfix: This option allows to ignore the first fixation of each trial. This is particularly useful if the stimuli are centred and a central fixation cross is presented before the trials. 1 (default option) keeps all the fixations, 2 ignores the first fixation of each trial.
% 8-	backgroundfile: e.g. 'facebackground.tif'. This option allows adding a background picture to the statistical fixation maps. The value is optional and has to be set to 0 or [] in order to specify the subsequent variables.
% 9-	specificfix: To select one or several specific fixations. e.g. [3 3] or [1 3]. This value is optional.
% 10-	searchspace: By default the size of the stimulus, xSize * ySize.  The search space size can be specified by indicating directly the number of pixels it contains or by using a black and white picture (e.g. ?facemask.tif?) where the black mask indicates the search space.
% 11-   scaledownup: To be specified as a 2 values vector ([scaledown scaleup]). It allows to set the color coded scale. It does present the advantage to have the same scale for the individual (specific to datasets) maps and the difference map. We recommand to run iMap a first time without setting this parameter in order to get an idea of the range and then to set it in a second time
% 12-   sigthres: Significativity threshold for the Pixel-test (one-tailed for the individual maps, two-tailed for the difference map). By default 0.5 (0.025 for the difference map)
%
% HOW TO USE IT
% Set the parameters in a configuration strcuture (e.g. cfg.xSize=400).
% Default values will be used for non-specified parameters
% Call the imap2 function with the configuration structure (e.g. imap2(cfg)).
% See the example folders for more specific explanations.
%
% INPUT
% The input data is a matrix with a fixation per line. The only crucial data are the coordinates and duration of the fixations and the
%   item numbers. Any other column can be use for specifying your
%   conditions.
%
% OUTPUT
% imap creates .tif pictures of the single and difference fixation maps merged with a background picture. It displays the significant
%   areas (white contours) based on a Pixel-test. It also creates .tif pictures with normalized scales.
%   It creates .txt files with global eye-tracking measures for both datasets (called eyebasicdataset1.txt and eyebasicdataset2.txt).
%   The columns are: the number of fixations, the total fixation duration, the mean fixation duration, the path length and the mean
%   saccade length). The lines correspond to the raw data files (participants, sessions).
%   The imap toolbox creates a text file called Zscore.txt that include the mean Zscores in the significant area for (respective columns)
%   the dataset 1, dataset 2, dataset 1 in the area 1 and area 2 (areas in which the fixation durations are significantly longer for
%   dataset 1 and 2 respectively), dataset 2 in the area 1 and area 2.
%   It also creates a .txt file with the cohen's d between both datasets for area 1 and 2 (areas in which the fixation durations are
%   significantly longer for dataset 1 and 2 respectively). The file is called cohend.txt
%   Finally, imap creates .txt files with the eye-tracking data in both the significant areas and the rest of the picture. The files are
%   called eyeareadataset1.txt and eyeareadataset2.txt and are organised the following way: mean fixation duration for area 1 then for
%   area 2 then for the rest of the picture. In the same way are path length, total fixation duration and number of fixations.
%
% EXAMPLES 
% The data in the examples are in .mat files (called data1.mat, data2.mat,...), the matrices are called "summary". This can be obtained
%   from any txt file (e.g. fixation report from EyeLink, Data Viewer)

%   Theory. These tests are easy to apply, requiring a mere four pieces of information; and they typically produce statistical thresholds
%   (or p-values) lower than the standard Bonferroni correction. An excellent non-technical reference is: K. J. Worsley (1996) the geometry
